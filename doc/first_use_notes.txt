need a "export selected and clear checkboxes" keyboard short cut,
screen should not move at all from the current point of focus in the table,
a simple growl like "files copies..." message would suffice

limit the number of loaded <audio> tags by only having a single 3-tuple of
Audio instances (only for the currently selected row), browsers seem to get pissed when there are too many

it would be badass to have a mark next to any file that was already in the export target
i find myself constantly looking at these files via the terminal, browser should provide someting as handy

force selection of a valid export dir that is not the same as the source for any export functionality to
work (export_page and export_selected)

the load row icon should be displayed instead of the stop|pause|play|play_looper when a row is not loaded

there should be a default export directory like LoopoffExport and directories
get autocreated if an explicit output target is not specified,
the OUTPUT <select> should default to "autocreate dir"

each playlist should remember what the currently selected row is persistently

none of the links with js behaviors should actually go anywhere (aka return false)

look for readme.yml (case insensitive) and overlay meta data from this onto files

only one row can play at a time, when play is hit on another row, playback stops the other one first
then resumes

clear all checkboxes and select all

all controllable widgets in the .controller_cell should be as close together as possible
to make the mouse usage as painless as possible

IN SAFARI

  There is a small gap at the end of the loop when in loop play mode
