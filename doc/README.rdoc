= Loopoff
Loopoff is a Rails + <audio> tag + git based audio loop management and archival system

It was written so I could spend less time managing audio files and more time making loops with
my Boss RC-50 and RC-20 loop stations.

The app is very unstable at this point, I hope to release something stable-ish/useful for others
by the end of the summer.
