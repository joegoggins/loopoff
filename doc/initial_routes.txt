 a link to /db

db/
  a list of all loopoff project directories (all sub-dirs of loop_db)
  each one links to a 
  <sub_dir_name> <export_link> <import_link> <newest_commit> <all_repo_files>
    export_link takes you to dir/export/<rel_path>/loopoff
      where <rel_path> is a dir containing the file with the most recent data modified
    import_link => same logic as export_link
    all_repo_files takes you to db/rc50/files/loopoff
    newest_commit takes you to db/rc50/commits/<sha>/loopoff
      where <sha> is the most recent commit

db/rc50
  links to 
  db/rc50/archive
  db/rc50/archive/loopoff
  
db/rc50/archive
  list all files in rc50 repo, their sha1
  <f_name><sha><date_committed><size>

db/rc50/archive/loopoff
  loopoff table view of all files in the rc50 repo

db/rc50/unarchived/
  a list of all non repo directories with links to their loopoff table pages

db/rc50/unarchived/<rel_path>/loopoff
  loopoff table page of files in <rel_path>

db/rc50/commits
  list view of all commits in the repo
  <date_committed><72 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)>

  each line links to a detail page db/rc50/commits/<sha>/

db/rc50/commits/<sha>/
  shows something like:
	commit b8491d654fa5ea9b5fb9e9ba77ffbfc560b9c263

  a loopoff table with the files in this commit

The same logic would hold for db/rc50/tags/<tag>/loopoff and db/rc50/tags as */commits/*
